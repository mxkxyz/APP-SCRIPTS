To show all installed modules in Command Prompt (CMD), 
PowerShell, and Kali Linux, you can use the following commands for each environment:
on the first system to get a list of the installed modules in the installed_modules.txt file. Now copy this file over to second system.
Now use pip to install these modules using:

##      $ pip install -r installed_modules.txt
                                                                  This will install all modules that were installed on the first system
