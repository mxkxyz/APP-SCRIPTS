The error indicates that the script cannot locate the `vmrun` command, which is part of VMware's CLI tools. This typically happens when VMware Workstation or VMware Player is not installed, 
or its executable directory is not added to your system's PATH.

### Steps to Resolve the Issue

1. **Verify VMware Installation**:
   - Ensure that VMware Workstation or VMware Player is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the official VMware website: [VMware Workstation Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html).

2. **Locate `vmrun.exe`**:
   - By default, `vmrun.exe` is located in the installation directory of VMware, typically:
     - **Windows**: `C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Workstation\`
     - **Linux**: `/usr/bin/vmrun`

3. **Add VMware to PATH**:
   - Add the directory containing `vmrun.exe` to your system's PATH environment variable:
     - **Windows**:
       1. Open **System Properties** (Win + Pause/Break â†’ Advanced System Settings).
       2. Click **Environment Variables**.
       3. Under **System Variables**, find `Path` and click **Edit**.
       4. Add the directory path to `vmrun.exe` (e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Workstation\`).
       5. Click **OK** to save changes.
     - **Linux**:
       Add the directory to your shell's PATH variable in `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.

4. **Test `vmrun` Command**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and type:
     ```bash
     vmrun -T ws list
     ```
   - This should list all running virtual machines if VMware is correctly installed and configured.

5. **Rerun the Script**:
   - After ensuring `vmrun` is accessible, rerun the Python script. It should now proceed without errors.

### Additional Debugging:
If the issue persists:
- Double-check the path to `vmrun.exe`.
- Reinstall VMware Workstation or Player to ensure all components are correctly installed.
